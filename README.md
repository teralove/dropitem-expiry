# Dropitem-Expiry
Notifies you when drops are about to expire.

## Chat commands:

**!Dropitems** - Displays remaining time on drops
**!ToggleDropitems** - Toggles countdown messages off/on 

Commands are not case-senstive. slash is supported but not required.


## Known issues:

* You must stay near the drops for timers to keep working. This means if you change channels or walk away, the timer for that item will stop.
* No dropitem names make it hard to distinguish which drops are what.


## Info:

* Ignores drops such as motes and strongboxes.
